My name is Sam Fader. I am an Enterprise Support Engineer at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Feel free to email me, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samfader/) me (can I use that as a verb?), or send a carrier pigeon to my door if you have any questions or comments.

This is my website and mostly contains stuff about maps and music, not so coincidentally because they're both a big part of what I enjoy in life!
