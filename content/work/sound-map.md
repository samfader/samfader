A map containing sound snippets I've recorded in various places across the world (well, so far, just the US).

## Features

Like I said, it's really minimal. Its doesn't even have grid or anything nice like that.

- Configurable color!
- Code Highlighting (HighlightJS).
- Responsive.
- Social Icon Links.
- No Grid no worry.
- Translatable.
